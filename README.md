## **COURSE DESCRIPTION**

There is an increasing demand for real-time forecasts of the world
around us. With the proliferation of big data sources and learning
algorithms, it is possible to produce forecasts on wide ranging
phenomenon, from the migrations of endangered species to outbreaks of
toxic plankton. Such forecasts have the potential to improve health,
quality of life, and economic activity. However, the algorithms and data
on which forecasts are based can also carry hidden biases and lead to
unintended consequences. This course will take a broad look at ocean
forecasting, from stakeholder engagement, to coding and analyzing
forecasts, to understanding the complexities of forecasts’ impacts.

[Project presentations](https://github.com/BigelowLab/ColbyForecasting/blob/main/assignments/presentation.md)

We will have a mini scientific conference where you will present your
project as you might do at a scientific conference. Plan your
presentation to be 10 minutes. You may use a slide show (e.g.power
point), but you are also welcome to use other styles. You should aim at
communicating a condensed version of what is in your project write-up.
Because the project write-up isn’t due for a few more days, it is
acceptable to have open-ended questions or areas where you ask the
audience for feedback. At the end of the presentations, we will have a
discussion that attempts to bring this collection of projects together
into an integrated description of what the Gulf of Maine might look like
in future decades.

## 10. Thursday Jan 29

- Continuation of presentations.

- Final project due
  - A ~2,000 word write-up of your Gulf of Maine projection. [Details
    can be found
    here](https://github.com/BigelowLab/ColbyForecasting/blob/main/assignments/writeup.md).

## **LEARNING OUTCOMES**

Discussions portion of your grade. If a class must be missed,
arrangements can be made–just contact the instructors as soon as
possible.

## **ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS**

We are committed to creating a course that is inclusive in its design.
If you encounter barriers, please let us know immediately so we can
determine if there is a design adjustment that can be made. We are happy
to consider creative solutions as long as they do not compromise the
intent of the assessment or learning activity.

If you are a student with a disability, or think you may have a
disability, you are also welcome to initiate this conversation with the
Dean of Students Office. The Dean of Students Office works with students
with disabilities and faculty members to identify reasonable
accommodations. Please [visit their
website](https://www.colby.edu/studentadvising/student-access-and-disability-services/)
for contact and other information. If you have already been approved for
academic accommodations, please connect within the two weeks of the
start of the semester so the office can develop an implementation plan.

## **MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH**

We are invested in the mental and emotional health of our students. Even
as we establish and maintain the academic standards of our course, we
value each of you as individuals with complex lives, identities, and
challenges.

Throughout the semester, the responsibilities of your Colby education
may interact with situational as well as ongoing mental and emotional
challenges in foreseeable and unforeseeable ways. If you are in need of
reasonable flexibility due to an emotional situation or an ongoing
mental health issue, please communicate as openly as possible with your
Class Dean, and/or members of the office of Access and Disability
Services, preferably in advance of the need, so that we can discuss how
your circumstances interface with course requirements. Together, we will
consider what is needed and what is possible. If we can discuss the
situation, we can manage the situation together.

Please do not allow academic responsibilities to prevent you from
getting help you need. Colby Counseling Services staff (207-859-4490)
and the staff in the Dean of Studies office (207-859-4560) are available
to connect with you. The safety of my students and every member of this
community is paramount. If you or someone you know is struggling with
thoughts of suicide or may be a danger to themselves or others, please
call the on-call counselor immediately (207-859-4490, press ‘0’).”

## **RESPECT FOR DIVERSITY**

It is our intent that students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives
be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be
addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students
bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. We
expect you to feel challenged and sometimes outside of your comfort zone
in this course, but it is our intent to present materials and activities
that are inclusive and respectful of all persons, no matter their
gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, socioeconomic status,
ethnicity, race, culture, perspective, and other characteristics.

Class rosters are provided to each instructor with the student’s legal
name. We will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate
name and/or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this early in the course
so that we may make appropriate changes to my records.

## **ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AND CONSEQUENCES FOR ACADEMIC DISHONESTY**

Honesty, integrity, and personal responsibility are cornerstones of a
Colby education and provide the foundation for scholarly inquiry,
intellectual discourse, and an open and welcoming campus community.
These values are articulated in the Colby Affirmation and are central to
this course. You are expected to demonstrate academic honesty in all
aspects of this course. If you understand our course expectations, give
credit to those whose work you rely on, and submit your best work, you
are highly unlikely to commit an act of academic dishonesty.

Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to: violating clearly
stated rules for taking an exam or completing homework; plagiarism
(including material from sources without a citation and quotation marks
around any borrowed words); claiming another’s work or a modification of
another’s work as one’s own; buying or attempting to buy papers or
projects for a course; fabricating information or citations; knowingly
assisting others in acts of academic dishonesty; misrepresentations to
faculty within the context of a course; and submitting the same work,
including an essay that you wrote, in more than one course without the
permission of the instructors.

Academic dishonesty is a serious offense against the college. Sanctions
for academic dishonesty are assigned by an academic review board and may
include: failure on the assignment, failure in the course, or suspension
or expulsion from the College.  
For more on recognizing and avoiding plagiarism, see:
libguides.colby.edu/avoidingplagiarism . For resources and information
on academic integrity, see: www.colby.edu/academicintegrity .

## **SEXUAL MISCONDUCT / TITLE IX STATEMENT**

Colby College prohibits and will not tolerate sexual misconduct or
gender-based discrimination of any kind. Colby is legally obligated to
investigate sexual misconduct (including, but not limited to, sexual
assault and sexual harassment) and other specific forms of behavior that
violate federal and state laws (Title IX and Title VII, and the Maine
Human Rights Act). Such behavior also requires the College to fulfill
certain obligations under two other federal laws, the Violence Against
Women Act (VAWA) and the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security
Policy and Campus Statistics Act (Clery Act). To learn more about what
constitutes sexual misconduct or to report an incident, see:
<https://life.colby.edu/your-safety/community-values-conflict-resolution-and-restorative-practice/student-handbook/>
.

We are committed to all Colby students feeling safe, accepted, and
included in all aspects of their college experiences, including this
course. Colby prohibits and will not tolerate sexual misconduct or
gender based discrimination of any kind and is obligated, by federal and
state laws, to respond to reports and provide resources to students. As
your professor, I am considered a “responsible employee” which requires
me to report incidence of sexual assault, sexual harassment, dating
violence, or stalking to the Title IX Coordinator.
